🧪 How It Works

Tasks are stored in React state

State is synced with localStorage using useEffect

UI updates dynamically based on state changes

Routing allows navigation without page reload

Edit mode uses useRef for auto focus

📸 Screens (Optional)

You can add screenshots here later for extra impact.
